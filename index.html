        'Listening to it with my ex in her apartment. Singing it together with me singing his part and her singing Taylor’s. She showed me this song one night when we were sitting on the couch together. I think I was a bit anxious cause it was a divergence from the plan. Now, truthfully, I wish I could loop that moment.',

        'This song reminds me of the summer time with this guy I was in a relationship with, we were in Golden CO looking out to the continental divide listening to this song during golden hour, and he later told me that it was at a certain point during this song where he looked at me and knew he was falling for me',
        'Sitting in the car with my boyfriend and him singing this song when it first came out. He just looked really good and idk why I just have such a distinct memory of his face and his voice.',
        'I attached this song to my past relationship. It was one of my first relationships in high school where all I wanted was attention but didn’t know the difference between good or bad attention. Looking back at that relationship makes me feel gross and this song triggers the same emotions. The specific memory was, I was hanging out at a park with them and I told them that this song reminded me of our relationship (aka this song says I should be dependent on you so I will try to be dependent on you). And I remember the feeling of just wanting their approval of me.',
